Predicting Wine Quality with ML Techniques

This projected utilizes multiple approaches to predict whether or not a wine will be of good quality or bad quality.



This project found that a random forest model performed best. The random forest model was able to predict the correct class with only a 0.165 misclassification rate
on unseen test data. The most important predictors of quality were volatile acidity and percentage of the volume of alcohol.

This dataset contains 6,497 observations. Each observation is a bottle of wine. There are 11 predictor variables. The response variable is a class- either “Good” or “Bad” wine.
